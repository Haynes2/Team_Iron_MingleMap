                <p>
                    Making new friends feels harder than ever. Social media keeps us connected but lacks the authenticity of real life interactions.
                    Many people struggle to start conversations in public spaces, unsure if others are open to socializing. 
                    Fear of rejection, social anxiety, and the performative nature of social media only add to the challenge. 
                    As a result, people remain isolated even when surrounded by potential friendships. 
                    It's time for a better way to meet and connect.

                    MingleMap is a smartphone application designed to bridge the gap between individuals who wish to form real-life 
                    social connections in public spaces. It will leverage real-time location-based technology and allow users to see 
                    others who are open to interaction within a shared environment. Unlike traditional social media apps, 
                    MingleMap facilitates immediate, 
                    in-person connections by displaying a curated list of nearby individuals engaging in similar activities.
